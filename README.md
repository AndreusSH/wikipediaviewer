# wikipediaviewer
This was an intermediate project for freecodecamp. Gave me the chance to work with wikipedia API and jQuery technology.

You can basically search for words and you can see displayed in the Wikipedia's correspondent articles 'snippets'. 
If you can click on the article, you are redirected to Wikipedia itself!

There is also a Random Article Button but for some reason it is not working anymore
